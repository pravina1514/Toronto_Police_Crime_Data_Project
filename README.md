This project analyzes crime data across Toronto, using a combination of ETL processes, machine learning models, and data visualization techniques to uncover trends and patterns in crime occurrences. The solution includes data integration using Talend Open Studio and Power BI dashboards to assist with decision-making. Predictive models were developed to enhance future crime prevention efforts, using algorithms like Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
